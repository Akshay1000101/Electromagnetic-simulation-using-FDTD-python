# Electromagnetic-simulation-using-FDTD-python
The purpose of the third edition of this book remains the same as that of the first
two editions: to enable the reader to learn the use of the finite-difference timedomain (FDTD) method in a manageable amount of time. For this reason, the
first four chapters are fundamentally the same as previous editions. The major
difference is the code has now been written in Python and each program contains the code for graphical outputs. The goal of these four chapters is to take
the reader through one-, two-, and three-dimensional FDTD simulation and, at
the same time, present the techniques for dealing with more complicated media.
In addition, some basic applications of signal processing theory are explained
to enhance the effectiveness of FDTD simulation.
Chapter 5 addresses some of the advantages of Python and presents some
programming topics the reader may not be familiar with. Some general programming strategies and best practices are discussed, and these practices are
applied to an FDTD program. Finally, an introduction to interactive widgets
is presented. This is a very useful feature that can help make programs that are
user-friendly to those without programming knowledge. This chapter is geared
toward those who know a limited amount about Python.
Chapter 6 contains an example of a more complicated engineering project:
simulating hyperthermia treatment. This is based on research done by the
xi
authors to simulate an annular phased array to plan hyperthermia cancer treatment. This chapter is meant to illustrate the power and practical application of
FDTD simulations to model how a solution is obtained. The principles applied
are all explained in Chapters 1â€“4.
